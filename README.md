<!------ # 👋 Hey there, I'm @sudo-bra-apt!

Welcome to my little corner of the internet 👨‍💻✨

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate web tinkerer who loves crafting clean, responsive, and engaging websites. Whether it's coding a slick landing page or experimenting with the backend, I'm all about bringing ideas to life—pixel by pixel.

My GitHub is where I build, break, rebuild, and sometimes just vibe with cool projects. Think of it as my digital workshop, where every commit gets me closer to becoming a full-stack wizard 🧙‍♂️💻.

## 🌐 Goals & Dreams

- 💡 Build beautiful, functional, and fast websites
- 🧰 Learn and master modern tools like React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and more
- ☁️ Host my own projects one day—yes, the dream is to click a link and say *"I made that!"*
- 🤝 Collaborate with like-minded devs and contribute to open source

## 🔧 Currently Learning

- Frontend frameworks (React is my jam right now)
- Backend basics with Express & Node.js
- How to deploy and host sites with Netlify, Vercel, or even a good ol’ VPS

## 🧠 Fun Fact

My username might scream *"command-line chaos"*, but really—it’s all about the creativity behind the code. Every line tells a story.

**Let's connect, collab, or just geek out about web stuff.**  
This is just the beginning. 🚧 Stay tuned as I turn ideas into hosted reality.----->
